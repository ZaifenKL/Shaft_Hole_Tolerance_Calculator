1) Type fit: condition between a hole and a shaft that are intended to fit together.

2) Base Size: the theorical or target dimension of the hole and shaft before tolerances.

3) Deviation: is the algebraic difference between a size and the corresponding basic size.

4) Fundamental deviation: either the upper or the lower deviation, depending on which is closer to the basic size.

5) Tolerance: the permissible range of sizes for the designed part.

6) IT Grade: International Tolerance Grade numbers (IT) are groups of tolerances that provide a way to specify the precision of the manufacturing process of the designed part.The standard uses capital letters for holes and lowercase letters for shaft, lower IT Grades imply higher precision.
