1) Type fit: assembly condition between a hole and a shaft.

2) Base Size: is the size to which limits or deviations are assigned and is the same for both members of the fit. 

3) Deviation: is the algebraic difference between a size and the corresponding basic size.

4) Fundamental deviation: either the upper or the lower deviation, depending on which is closer to the basic size.

5) Tolerance: the difference between the maximum and minimum size limits of a part.

6) IT Grade: International Tolerance Grade numbers (IT) designate groups of tolerances such that the tolerances for a particular IT number have the same relative level of accuracy but vary depending on the basic size.The standard uses capital letters for holes and lowercase letters for shaft.
